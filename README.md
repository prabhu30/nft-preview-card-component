## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Through this project, I learnt how block elements behave, how justify-content property of flexbox works, and few more things.

### Continued development
- This card component may not be used widely across day-to-day websites, since this is related to crypto. So, If i am going to work with ethereum in the future, then I might make use of this card component during design phase.
